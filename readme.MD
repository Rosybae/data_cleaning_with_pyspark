# Data Cleaning and transformation with pyspark

Rheeza Clinics & Pharmaceuticals conducted a research on
Naproxen - a drug that has been claimed to normalize the
blood pressure of teens and young adults.
The trial was carried out in three of their clinic branches on
over 2000 individuals of mixed genders from ages 14 - 22
between February and May 2021.
This trial involved two groups - The in-active (Placebo) and
active (Naproxen) groups to test the effect of the actual
drug (Naproxen).
Records of all procedures were kept; and extracted from
the storage for the ML Engineers to develop algorithms for
the next stages of the experiment.
